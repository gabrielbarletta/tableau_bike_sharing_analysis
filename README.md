# NYC Bike Sharing Analysis

Link to my tableau story: https://public.tableau.com/shared/XYP3W5HFQ?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

The main idea of this project is to analyze data from NYC CitiBike and create a presentation to present to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa.
Throught the analysis we will answer questions like:
* Who uses bikeshare programs?
* What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
* What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
* How much are the bikes used and by whom?

The above map shows where the trips have been started. The most populated area of the map means that it is a touristic area.

The heat map help us demonstastre weekly using patterns. The patterns indicate the heavy bike usage during weekday commute times, and weekend usage thorught the whole day.

This graph shows us that the trips are under 1 hour in length.

This heatmaps make it more apparent how many more rides are taken by male subscribers users. 

# Summary
In conclusion, it is evident that bike sharing services are very popular in big cities with a vast population.

If I were to keep going with the analysis i would explore:
1. Trips at the start of the work day and where the trips are ended. 
2. Average trip duration, by birth year, by gender, and see what the data says.
