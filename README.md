# NYC Bike Sharing Analysis
The main idea of this project is to analyze data from NYC CitiBike and create a presentation to present to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa.
Throught the analysis we will answer questions like:
* Who uses bikeshare programs?
* What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
* What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
* How much are the bikes used and by whom?
